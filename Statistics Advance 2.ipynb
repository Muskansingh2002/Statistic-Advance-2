    "Mean (μ):\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the central point of the distribution and is the location parameter. It determines the center of the distribution.\n",

    "The standard deviation is the scale parameter and measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Independence:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampled observations must be independent of each other. This means the outcome of one observation does not affect the outcome of another. In practical terms, this is often achieved by random sampling or ensuring that each sample is taken without replacement in a sufficiently large population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Identically Distributed:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampled observations should come from the same distribution with the same probability distribution function. This implies that each random variable in the sample has the same mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Sample Size:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size (n) should be sufficiently large. While there is no hard and fast rule for what constitutes a \"large\" sample size, a common rule of thumb is that n≥30 is often sufficient. However, if the underlying distribution is heavily skewed or has high kurtosis (heavy tails), larger sample sizes may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Finite Mean and Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The population from which samples are drawn must have a finite mean (μ) and a finite variance (𝜎**2). If the mean or variance is infinite, the CLT does not apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.For Small Sample Sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sample size is small and the population distribution is normal, the sample mean will also be normally distributed regardless of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population distribution is not normal, smaller sample sizes may not yield a normally distributed sample mean. In such cases, the CLT’s approximation may not be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Practical Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical scenarios, when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small, the t-distribution is often used instead of the normal distribution. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution."
